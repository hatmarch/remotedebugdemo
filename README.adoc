Create and clone into a directory where you would like to work.

Note that this is setup to work with the VisualStudio Code link:https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote-release[Remote Development Extension Pack].

== Prerequisites
It is assumed that you have:

* command line access to docker (pointing into the OpenShift cluster) for instance footnote:[Or you need some way to upload container images to the cluster]

----
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1" 
# set to Docker Host on cluster
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.99.100:2376" 
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/Users/marc.hildenbrand/.minishift/profiles/oc/certs" 
----

* command line access to openshift-cli that points into an accessible OpenShift cluster)
* an OpenShift project you have 'edit' access to (will be called remote-debug throughout this example)
* You must have a public route to whichever service you expose footnote:[If you don't have a public route, you can instead connect on a NodePort of a pod]

== OpenShift Setup

You can skip this section if you already have a destination project that you'd like to work in, just bear in mind the pre-requisites above.

----
$ oc new-project remote-debug
Now using project "remotedebug" on server "https://192.168.99.100:8443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app centos/ruby-25-centos7~https://github.com/sclorg/ruby-ex.git

to build a new example application in Ruby.
----

== Build the Application

We're going to build a simple springboot application that will be folded into a docker container.  This container will be associated with a deployment.

Start at the root of the cloned git repo and build the application locally

----
$ mvn clean package
...

[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

Test that the application runs locally

----
$ java -jar target/remote-debug-demo-0.0.1.jar
$ curl localhost:8080
----

== Build the Container

Now that the target is built, we want to build it into our Dockerfile.  _Notice that the only exposed port is the port that SpringBoot wants to listen on, 8080_

----

----

Check that the image has been uploaded to the cluster

----
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                     TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hatmarch/myremotedebug                         v1                  38d2afa981db        3 days ago          752MB
----

Now create a deployment config that uses that image

----
$ oc create -f kubefiles/myremotedebug-deployment.yml 
deployment.extensions/myremotedebug created
----

Then create the service to reference this deployment

----
$ oc create -f kubefiles/myremotedebug-service.yml 
service/myremotedebug created
----

[NOTE]
====
If you do not have a route to the service then you can connect to the nodeport of the service.

If you have admin access then you can:

. Edit the kubefiles/myremotedebug-route.yml replacing the highlighted spots with the ip address of your cluster:

image:RouteUpdate.png[Replace with cluster ip]

. Then run the following command:

----
$ oc create -f kubefiles/myremotedebug-route.yml 
route.route.openshift.io/remote-debug created
----

This will create a route through the Dynamic DNS service link:https://nip.io[nip.io].
====

You should now see your app and deployment under the remote-debug project

image::CreatedDeployment.png[OpenShift Console]

And be able to access it
----
$ curl http://myremotedebug-remote-demo.192.168.99.102.nip.io/
Aloha from Spring Boot! 1 on 1563536cbdf2
----

== [[SimulateCrash]]Simulate a Crash

Let's pretend you call an endpoint and it causes a crash

----
$ curl http://myremotedebug-remote-demo.192.168.99.102.nip.io/crash
{"timestamp":1565993738150,"status":500,"error":"Internal Server Error","exception":"java.lang.IllegalAccessError","message":"No message available","path":"/crash"}
----

Or this:

image::CrashOutput.png[Crash Output]

We will want to open a debug port on 5000.  Not only is there no publically accessible route to this port on the container/node, there is no internally accessible port set up for this.  Yet.

== Create Debuggable Container Image

We don't always want the debugger to be running in the container, but we also want to keep the container as immutable as possible.  What we'll do instead is to expose some environment variables into the entrypoint of the container.

Notice the Dockerfile-Debug file in the root of the repo.  Notice the following changes:

image::DockerfileChanges.png[Changes to the Dockerfile]

The JAVA_OPTIONS environment variable will allow us to container whether the java entry point is run with jdwp support.

Let's create a new image based on the Dockerfile-Debug file

----
$ docker build -t hatmarch/myremotedebug:v2 -f Dockerfile-Debug .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  15.14MB

 ---> Using cache
 ---> 38d2afa981db
Successfully built 38d2afa981db
----

Now let's update our deployment to point to the new image

----
$ oc set image deployment/myremotedebug myremotedebug=hatmarch/myremotedebug:v2
deployment.extensions/myremotedebug image updated
----

If you'd like, go back to the "<<SimulateCrash,Simulate a Crash>>" section and prove that debug port is still not open.

Next, we want to update the environment variables in our deployment to activate remote debugging services.  For this, take a look at the contents of the Java_Debug.txt file.

It will cause the debugger to run listening on port 5000.  It is also setup NOT to suspend execution until a debugger is attached.  You can change that functionality if you'd like.

----
$  oc set env deployment/myremotedebug JAVA_OPTIONS="$(cat Java_Debug.txt)"
deployment.extensions/myremotedebug updated
----

This should change the deployment and trigger the creation of a new pod.  You can check this in the console.

image:EnvVariables.png[New Environment variables for debugger]

Now all that's left is being able to connect to the pod.  For this, we will use *port forwarding*

== Debug the Pod

Port forwarding works by routing a port on our localhost to a port on a *specific* pod.  First, find the specific pod you want

----
$ oc get pods
NAME                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
myremotedebug-5679bf775c-gwzpx   1/1       Running   0          6m
----

Next set up port forwarding to port 5000 (the port the debugger should be listening on) on that pod.  _Do this from a terminal on your local machine_

----
$ oc port-forward myremotedebug-5679bf775c-gwzpx 32000:5000
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:32000 -> 5000
Forwarding from [::1]:32000 -> 5000
----

Now our local port 32000 should be forwarded to port 5000 on pod myremotedebug-5679bf775c-gwzpx.  Note that you can also forward to port 5000 is you like.  See info link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/port_forwarding.html[here].

Now we open a _new_ terminal whilst the port forwarding is active and open the java command line debugger.footnote:[Of course you can also use the concepts here and connect with your IDE debugging tools of choice as well.  JDB is used for illustrative purposes]  Note that the debugger is attaching to _our local machine_ (the machine from whence we issued the oc port-forward command)

----
$ jdb -attach localhost:32000 -sourcepath src/main/java 
Set uncaught java.lang.Throwable
Set deferred uncaught java.lang.Throwable
Initializing jdb ...
> stop in com.hatmarch.MyRESTController.doCrash()
Set breakpoint com.hatmarch.MyRESTController.doCrash()
----

Then hit the service as usual footnote:[If you have mutliple pods running, bear in mind that the route and service may not immediately load balance to your pod]

----
$ curl http://myremotedebug-remote-demo.192.168.99.102.nip.io/crash
----

And then you should see the debugger terminal:
----
Breakpoint hit: "thread=http-nio-8080-exec-3", com.hatmarch.MyRESTController.doCrash(), line=30 bci=0
30            throw new IllegalAccessError();

http-nio-8080-exec-3[1] list
26       }
27    
28       @RequestMapping("/crash") 
29       public String doCrash() {
30 =>         throw new IllegalAccessError();
31       }
32    
33       
34    }
----

Happy Debugging!
